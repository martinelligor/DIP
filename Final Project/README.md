# Final project: Remaining puzzle pieces counter
## Area: Image segmentation

> Description: The main idea of this project is to implement a tool that will detect how many pieces are remaining to finish a puzzle. The idea is to give to the
algorithm an image that contains, in the scene, the remaining pieces of the puzzle in a blank surface. The algorithm will detect the pieces by using the canny edge
detecting algorithm.
